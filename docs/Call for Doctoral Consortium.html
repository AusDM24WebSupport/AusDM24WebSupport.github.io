                    <h1>Call for Doctoral Consortium</h1>
                    <p>The Australasian Data Science and Machine Learning Conference has established itself as the
                        premier Australasian meeting for both practitioners and researchers in data mining. It is
                        devoted to the art and science of intelligent analysis of (usually big) data sets for meaningful
                        (and previously unknown) insights. This conference will enable the sharing and learning of
                        research and progress in the local context and breakthroughs in data mining algorithms and their
                        applications across all industries.</p>
                    <p>The doctoral consortium (DC) of AusDM 2023 is aimed at providing Ph.D. students at all stages
                        with the opportunity to receive feedback on their research (from established researchers in
                        their fields), and interact closely with other researchers and Ph.D. students. Apart from extra
                        feedback, we hope to provide students with new contacts and professional networking
                        opportunities.</p>
                    <p>We do not expect you to have addressed all research questions, nor expect you to have completed
                        the Ph.D. However, we expect you to show an understanding of your research area and to have a
                        clear plan towards addressing your research goals. This symposium is the best place to discuss
                        these research questions with experienced researchers and fellow students to receive informed
                        feedback.</p>
                    <p>Research students who have an accepted main conference paper are also encouraged to submit to the
                        DC session. The conference is planned to be an in-person event in Auckland, New Zealand.
                        Participants from Australia and New Zealand are encouraged to attend it personally. There will
                        be an option for overseas participants to attend the conference virtually.</p>
                    <h1>Submission Process</h1>
                    <p>Submission Requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A 1-2 paged document with student information and a summary of the student’s research.</li>
                        <li>Student’s information should include the student’s name, email address, homepage, university
                            affiliation, Ph.D. (or other Postgraduate level research degrees) start date, expected
                            graduation date, and name and email of Ph.D. supervisor(s).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The electronic submission must be in PDF format only and made through the AusDM Easychair link
                        here. The deadline for proposal submissions is the 30th of September 2023. We will notify the
                        successful applicants by the 21st of October 2023.</p>

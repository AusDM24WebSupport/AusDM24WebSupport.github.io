                    <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
                    <p>The <strong>Australasian Data Science and Machine Learning Conference (AusDM)</strong>, formerly
                        known as the Australasian Data Mining Conference, has established itself as the premier
                        Australasian meeting for both practitioners and researchers in data mining. It is devoted to the
                        art and science of intelligent analysis of (usually big) data sets for meaningful (and
                        previously unknown) insights. This conference will enable the sharing and learning of research
                        and progress in the local context and breakthroughs in data mining algorithms and their
                        applications across all industries.</p>
                    <p>Since AusDM’02, the conference has showcased research in data mining, providing a forum for
                        presenting and discussing the latest research and developments. Built on this tradition,
                        AusDM’23 will facilitate the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas, experience and potential
                        research directions. Speciﬁcally, the conference seeks to showcase: Research Prototypes;
                        Industry Case Studies; Practical Analytics Technology; and Research Student Projects. AusDM’23
                        will be a meeting place for pushing forward the frontiers of data science and machine learning
                        in academia and industry.</p>
                    <p>AusDM’23 will deliver keynote speeches, invited talks, full paper presentations, abstracts,
                        tutorials, workshops, social events, etc.</p>
                    <h1>Publication and Topics</h1>
                    <p>We are calling for papers, both research and applications, and from both academia and industry,
                        for publication and presentation at the conference. All papers will go through double-blind,
                        peer–review by a panel of international experts. The AusDM 2023 proceedings will be published by
                        Springer Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) and become available
                        immediately after the conference. Please note that AusDM’23 requires that at least one author
                        for each accepted paper register for the conference and present their work for the paper to be
                        published in the proceeding.</p>
                    <p>AusDM’23 invites contributions addressing current research in data mining and knowledge discovery
                        as well as experiences, novel applications and future challenges.</p>

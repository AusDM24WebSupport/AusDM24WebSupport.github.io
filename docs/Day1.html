                        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
                        <p>In this talk, I will address the paradox of capability and vulnerability that arises when
                            adopting a new technology for use in cyber security. Although AI/ML offers significant
                            advantages, the capabilities demonstrated in controlled environments with synthetic custom
                            datasets may not directly translate to operational settings and actual noisy data generated
                            in those environments, potentially creating new vulnerabilities that adversaries can
                            exploit. I will share my experiences operationalizing AI/ML for various security challenges,
                            such as threat hunting and incident response, highlighting real-life implications for
                            critical infrastructures, government, and industry.</p>

                        <p>Dr Seyit Camtepe is a Principal Research Scientist at CSIRO's Data61. He is head of Data61’s
                            Cyber Security Automation and Orchestration team with 20+ researchers and engineers at all
                            levels. He is also leading the Security Automation and Orchestration theme of the Cyber
                            Security CRC with a portfolio of more than 16 industry and government-partnered research
                            projects. Dr Camtepe was an ECARD lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT).
                            He was a Senior Researcher and Research Group Leader in Cyber Security at the Technische
                            Universitaet Berlin (TU-Berlin - the first German university to adopt the name
                            &quot;Technische Universität&quot;). Dr Camtepe received his PhD degree in computer science
                            from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI - America's oldest technological research
                            university), New York, USA, in 2007.</p>

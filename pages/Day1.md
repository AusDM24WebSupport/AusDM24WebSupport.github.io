#### Abstract:

In this talk, I will address the paradox of capability and vulnerability that arises when adopting a new technology for use in cyber security. Although AI/ML offers significant advantages, the capabilities demonstrated in controlled environments with synthetic custom datasets may not directly translate to operational settings and actual noisy data generated in those environments, potentially creating new vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit. I will share my experiences operationalizing AI/ML for various security challenges, such as threat hunting and incident response, highlighting real-life implications for critical infrastructures, government, and industry.

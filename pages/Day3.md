#### Abstract:

One of the most urgent issues facing Australian and other First Nations peoples is the repatriation of their ancestors' bodily remains, many of which are still held in Western scientific institutions. The return of these remains for proper reburial is a critical matter of cultural and ethical importance. However, success in this effort often depends on locating records—scattered across scientific and historical literature from 1790 to 1970—that document the theft, donation, sale, or exchange of these remains between institutions. In this talk, I will explore how text-mining techniques can be applied to identify and extract this crucial information from vast textual archives, providing invaluable support for repatriation. The talk will highlight practical challenges, innovative approaches and the potential impact of these technologies in empowering communities to reclaim their cultural heritage.

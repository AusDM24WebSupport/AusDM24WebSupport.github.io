#### Abstract:

This tutorial explores Complex Network and Spatial Data Analysis in Julia, targeting data miners, spatial scientists, network analysts, urban planners, and researchers. Initially, it covers network analysis foundations with Graphs.jl and LightGraphs.jl, advancing to community detection and visualization using CommunityDetection.jl and GraphPlot.jl. Subsequently, it delves into spatial data analysis, elucidating data manipulation and visualization with GeoIO.jl, Makie.jl, and GeoMakie.jl, and exploring spatial statistics with GeoStats.jl. The final segment unveils the interplay between spatial and network data through case studies, emphasizing spatial proximity evaluation and SpatialGraphs.jl for handling geospatially embedded networks. Through hands-on exercises, attendees will gain practical insights into leveraging Julia for complex network and spatial data analysis.

Giulio Valentino Dalla Riva is a Senior Lecturer in Data Science in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Canterbury, and he is the founder of Baffelan â€“ Data Climbing, a boutique data consultancy company. His research explores and tries to make sense of what happens in complex, dynamical networks. He is interested in ecological networks and the evolutionary processes that modify them in time. Giulio develops mathematical and statistical tools to study the relationship between ecological biodiversity and evolutionary diversity. He is also interested in social networks, especially online, and trying to understand what makes them work in the way they work.

A tiny warmup has been prepared for anybody who would like to attend this tutorial (it makes the experience smoother by already installing some stuff). It can be found here: [https://gvdr.github.io/megachile/23/ausdm/0_setup.html](https://gvdr.github.io/megachile/23/ausdm/0_setup.html)
